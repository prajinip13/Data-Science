Diabetes Prediction

The aim of this project to analyze the medical factors of a patient such as Glucose Level,Blood Pressure, 
Skin Thickness, Insulin Level and many others to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not.

The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes.
All patients here are female at least 21 years old.

The data includes several medical predictor variables such as Glucose Level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, 
Insulin Level, number of pregnancies, BMI, age, and more. The target variable, "Outcome," indicates whether the 
patient has diabetes (1) or does not have diabetes (0). The dataset was carefully selected from a larger database,
adhering to certain constraints to maintain accuracy and relevance.
